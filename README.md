Trying out some different network architectures for deep learning. 

Continuation from **gelbooru-analysis** repository.

Step 4: Network architecture
--------------
~~Use TensorFlow. (Yuck! Google!)~~

Better: Use [Keras](https://keras.io/) with TensorFlow backend.
And read a lot of papers/tutorials.

Ideas: 
* My own [Deepdreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepdreaming) Network.
* Image recognition/ automatic labeling.
* Generating networks for my very own AI generated Waifu.

Step 5: Training and Profiling âœ“
--------------
Or: How to find a PC with Nvidia GPU which is fast enough for processing all this data.

Idea: Use pool computers for training. 

~~Save images at some online storage and dynamically load them (in e.g. 100 MB batches) for training.~~

Save tar archive of lossy compressed images at some online storage. Then load everything into RAM and shuffle them around as you want.
